# Webly
As a marketplace, Webly enables you to search and discover online webinars. If you are a webinar host, you can sell tickets for your webinars, whether free or paid.

Made for DEV x MongoDB Atlas Hackathon Project.

## Background
On the internet, information about webinars is scattered about on many different platforms. In my country, Indonesia, to buy webinar tickets we mostly go to Instagram and contact the admin directly via another messaging platform (e.g. Whatsapp, line).

Why not gather them in one place where we can sell and buy webinar tickets easily? This is where Webly comes into play.
